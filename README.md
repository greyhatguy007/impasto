  <img src=".github/assets/hero.jpg" alt="The desk: the island with a track playing, widgets down the right, a note deck on the left edge, a terminal with the lava lamp greeting, and the dock" width="100%">
</p>

The name is the technique the wallpapers are painted in: paint laid on thick
enough to keep the mark of the brush. It is a shell first and a dotfiles
repository second — `home/.config/quickshell` is most of the code, and the rest
of `home/` is the desk around it: the terminal, the prompt, two editors, two
file managers, a browser, a chat client, the login screen. **Change the
wallpaper and all of it follows.**

## The island

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/island.gif" alt="The island at rest, opening a glance under the pointer, becoming the control centre, then the launcher doing a sum and listing the shell's places, then a notification arriving" width="100%">
</p>

**The island is one object that changes shape.** A black capsule in the middle
of the bar rests on the time and turns into everything else: the glance under
the pointer, the control centre, the launcher, the overview, a notification, a
game — each the size of what is in it, with no title and no close button. What
is running sits either side of the time, and every module on the bar opens into
the island rather than into a popup of its own.

## The bar

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/bar-styles.jpg" alt="The same bar in its three styles: grouped round the island, spread to the two edges, and everything inside one capsule" width="100%">
</p>

**Three styles, one layout.** Pieces are dragged out of a catalogue onto a
picture of the bar, then drawn grouped round the island, spread to the edges, or
all inside one capsule. A module tells you something and opens its detail; a
button opens something — any panel the control centre does, the capture
surface, or Settings. Each shows its symbol or its ring, with its figure
always, never or under the pointer — two settings for the whole bar, and any
piece can have a look of its own.

**On more than one screen, every screen gets the whole bar**, and the island is
live on the one you are typing on. Each screen keeps widgets and notes of its
own and the dock is on all of them, a workspace number brings that workspace to
the screen you are on, and the brightness keys dim that screen — an external
monitor over DDC/CI.

## The launcher and the dock

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/launcher-and-dock.jpg" alt="The launcher listing applications ranked by use, the clipboard history with an image drawn in its row, and the dock with the terminal's menu open over its windows" width="100%">
</p>

**The first character says what the field is for.** Plain text searches
applications, `=` calculates, `@` finds an open window, `!` starts a countdown,
`'` is the clipboard history, and `>` is the shell itself — every panel and
setting by name. Applications are ranked by what you actually launch.

**The dock holds what you pinned, then whatever else is open**, and the same
pins come first in the launcher. Right-click an icon for its windows by name.

## The desktop

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/desktop-themes.jpg" alt="The same wall of widgets split down the middle: Modern on the left, figures with captions; Analogue on the right, a thermometer, a wall calendar, a battery cell, a knob, gauges, a parcel, a joystick" width="100%">
</p>

**Any module can live on the wallpaper**, on a grid, in four shapes: a square,
a card, a large square and a band. Right-click the wallpaper to arrange — a card
holds every module, a corner is pulled for another shape, and a click
opens that widget's own look — for a photo widget, the picture of your own it
holds.

**Two themes on the same modules**: *Modern* is a figure with a caption,
*Analogue* draws each one as an object, and either is a choice per widget. A
spectrum of whatever is playing sits on the grid as bare bars, or runs along a
whole edge under the windows.

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/repaint.gif" alt="The wallpaper changing three times, and the bar, the widgets, the terminal and the system monitor repainting with each one" width="100%">
</p>

**The palette comes out of the painting.** Pick a wallpaper and its colours
reach everything at once: the island and the widgets, the terminal and the
prompt, btop, cava, yazi, neovim, VSCodium, the GTK, Qt and KDE windows, Thunar
down to its folders, Vesktop, Zen and Spotify. Or pick one of nine palettes
instead. The desk comes with forty paintings, in the style it is named after.

In the terminal, the prompt is laid out like the bar, and `fa` greets you with
fastfetch beside an animated scene drawn in pixel art out of the palette.

## Notes and tasks

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/notes-and-tasks.jpg" alt="The deck of pastel notes in handwriting, one note open with the island become yellow paper, the kanban board with three lanes, and a task open with its day and lane" width="100%">
</p>

**A note is paper**: a pastel square with a title and the body in handwriting.
`SUPER + S` opens the deck; on the wallpaper a note sits on a square, or stacks
with others along an edge as tabs that peek out under the pointer.

**A board for what has to be done.** `SUPER + K` is to do, doing, done, with
cards dragged between the lanes, and a task's day shows as a dot under the
month wherever a month is drawn.

## Games

**Eleven small games, played in the island** — `SUPER + G` opens a shelf, and
the island becomes the board.

## Lock and login

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/lock-and-login.jpg" alt="The lock screen resting on its clock over the blurred desk, the island growing round the padlock while it looks for a face, and the SDDM login screen over a blurred painting — the same island, clock and pill" width="100%">
</p>

**The shell locks the session itself**, over the blurred desk, and the login
screen is the same lock with the desk taken away: an SDDM theme with the same
island, the same clock and the same pill, over a blurred painting. Both rest on
the clock alone. Any key brings in your account and the field, and is already
the first letter of your password; Escape sends them away again. The clock is
stacked or on one line, in Settings → Session → Lock screen, and the login
screen always stacks it. The picture and the name are your account's, and
Settings → Session changes them for both screens at once: drop an image on the
card and it is made square and kept where the login screen reads it; type a
name and it becomes the account's full name.

**With an infrared camera, the lock opens for your face.** Touch a key or the
pointer and the island grows under the camera, a ring turns around its
padlock while it looks, closes green, the padlock opens and the blur lifts off
the desk. It is its own conversation beside the password, so a face it does
not know never costs you a try, and the login screen still asks for the
password after a boot. Settings → Session lists the faces it knows, adds
another, removes one, and lets you try it without locking.

## Settings

**Settings is the one panel that is not the island** — an ordinary window where
each option is drawn as the thing it changes, and profiles keep whole desks
under names: *Moon castle*, *Fuji* and *Night bay* come with it.

## Integrations

**The board can have a server behind it**: point Settings → Integrations at a
self-hosted Vikunja and the kanban syncs both ways — the server's tasks fold
into the same list, and changes made here are sent back.

**The calendar can have Google in it**: a desktop OAuth client and one press
of Connect, and the days around the shell gain your events — blue dots on the
month beside the task dots, events under a day's tasks in the control centre,
a *Coming up* list in the date module, and the desktop calendar scrolling
through weeks with every event day one click away. Read-only, and the refresh
token is kept on the machine that connected, never in the settings file.

**The phone can be on the bar too**: with KDE Connect paired, its charge gets
a module and a face of its own, its music can take the desk's player, and a
copy made on the phone can land on the desk's clipboard — each a switch, and
each only offered if that pairing answers to it.

**The assistants can be counted**: a bar module and a desktop face measure the
current block and the last seven days, read from the transcripts on this
machine. Nothing is sent anywhere, and the transcript directories are yours to
name if they do not live where the shell looks.

The full walkthrough — Google Cloud setup, token storage, transcript
directories, every status message and their fixes — is in
[docs/INTEGRATIONS.md](docs/INTEGRATIONS.md).

## Installation

Arch Linux, and Hyprland 0.56 or newer (tested on 0.56.2), configured in Lua.
Run it from a terminal, in the Hyprland session or on a console before there
is one. The two plugins are built against the compositor that is running, so
from a console the first session opens a terminal that builds them:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreumassanet/impasto.git ~/impasto
cd ~/impasto
./setup install
```

It installs the packages it is missing — upgrading the system in the same step,
as Arch asks — oh-my-zsh, everything in `home/` into your home and everything
in `system/` into `/`, the two Hyprland plugins and the vector cursor, and the
login screen, switched on unless your machine already uses another display
manager. It sets up Thunar, VSCodium, Vesktop and Spotify, dark GTK
applications, and what opens which kind of file — leaving alone any your
machine already has an answer for. Where there is an infrared camera it
installs howdy-next and asks to enrol your face. It asks for your password
through sudo for pacman, for the copy into `/`, and to let spicetify patch
Spotify. A program that is open, or a Spotify you have never started, is
skipped with the reason and set up by the next `update`. After that they follow
the wallpaper on their own; Spotify from its next start.

Run `./setup` with nothing after it and it asks instead: the verbs on one
screen, and what an install may leave out on the next, which is the flags below
with somewhere to press them.

| Flag | |
|---|---|
| `--skip-packages` | install nothing; copy and build only |
| `--skip-system` | leave `/` alone — no login screen, and no password for it |
| `--skip-plugins` | no shake to find, no glass |
| `--skip-extras` | leave Thunar, VSCodium, Vesktop, Spotify, GTK and face unlock alone |
| `--aur-helper yay\|paru` | which helper builds the AUR half — built from the AUR if you have neither |
| `--noconfirm` | take the default at every question |
| `-n`, `--dry-run` | say what would happen, and do none of it |

```bash
./setup update       # git pull, then install again — the same flags
./setup uninstall    # remove what it installed, and put back what it moved aside
./setup help         # every verb and flag
```

`update` follows the branch you cloned: `main` moves only when a version is
released, and work in progress lives on `dev`. The version installed is under
Settings → System, with what the branch has waiting since it and a button that
runs `update` in a terminal.

**Nothing is linked: `setup` copies**, and remembers what it wrote. A file of
yours already in the way is moved to `~/.local/state/impasto/backups/` first; a
file you edit afterwards is left alone, with the new version beside it as
`<name>.new`, and one you delete stays deleted — the wallpapers you do not want,
say. Settings → System lists both, each with a button to put impasto's version
back. Editing the repository itself? `./setup sync` copies it onto the
desk, and `./setup sync --watch` keeps doing it on every save.

Every package is listed in `packages/pacman.txt` and `packages/aur.txt`, grouped
by what it is for; an optional one that is missing takes its own control away
rather than failing.

## Keys

Every key belongs to a profile: Settings → Keys changes any of them, the
compositor's included, and switching profile switches them all. A few worth
knowing first:

- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>Return</kbd> a terminal, <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>Space</kbd>
  the launcher, <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>Q</kbd> closes the window
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>1</kbd>…<kbd>0</kbd> a workspace, on the screen you are
  on, <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>TAB</kbd> all of them at once
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>ALT</kbd> <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> the other screen,
  adding <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> takes the workspace with you
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>X</kbd> the session menu, <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>L</kbd>
  locks
- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> <kbd>H</kbd> every other key, on the island

## Credits

These are worth your time whether or not you use this repository. No code was
copied from any of them; what carried over from the shells are ideas — one file
per island state, one transient signal for every ephemeral event, input
debounced to one frame, and a capture that photographs the screen and draws the
selection on the photograph.
